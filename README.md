JavaScript to help algebra 2 students understand math concepts, including graphs


JavaScript using Katex, jsxgraph and math.js to help algebra 2 students math intuition. Includes graphing concepts and matrix operatioins. 

The script uses random nubers in the problem examples, so students can view each example multiple times with variations for practice. 

I use this as an instructor at Mahidol University Interantaional College (MUIC) in Thailand to address typical problems in understanding the needed math concpets.
